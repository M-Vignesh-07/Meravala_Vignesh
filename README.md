I’m Vignesh Meravala, pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM University, AP (2024–2028). Passionate about coding, problem-solving, and new technologies, I’m building skills in C, C++, Python, DSA, and teamwork. My goal is to grow into a skilled software engineer  while  learning with others.
